Screech "release notes"

**Herumi Mods**

To build the Prsym validator, I had to make a couple of PRs to Herumi libraries.  For details review these links:

- https://github.com/herumi/mcl/pull/82

Note: the commit from this PR is already merged into MCL master

- https://github.com/herumi/bls-eth-go-binary/pull/22

Note: herumi modified the build process to fit with his workflow and already merged it into master.  I tested it and it works

**Prysm Mods**

I made a terrible hack to proto/beacon/p2p/v1/generated.ssz.go.  The patches dir in this repo contains a patch file with the mods, but this will need to be fixed properly.  Sorry! 


**Run Validator**

This is how I ran the validator and prsym.  There might be some issues with some of the options bc the validator has trouble communicating at first.  

1) copy the validator to the lattice1

scp validator root@lattice-c23c:/mnt/mmcblk0p1/

2) run prysm 

prysm.sh beacon-chain --verbosity info \
--disable-discv5 \
--interop-eth1data-votes \
--interop-genesis-time $(date +%s) \
--interop-num-validators 64 \
--rpc-host $(ipconfig getifaddr en0)

3) run validator from `/mnt/mmcblk0p1/`

./validator --keymanager=interop --keymanageropts='{"keys":64}' --datadir $PWD --beacon-rpc-provider 192.168.1.212:4000 --force-clear-db
